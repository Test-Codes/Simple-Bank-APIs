# SimpleBankAPIs

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application

Design and implement a very simple API server bank program.
The server should support 2 functions as API endpoints: deposits and withdrawals.
After each API call, the server should return the current balance in JSON format.

You shouldnâ€™t spend more than about an 1 hour on this assignment;
so please do not implement authentication or security features or worry about scalability,
but be aware of these issues and be prepared to talk about them.
You can use whatever server language/platform that you know best.
Please upload your code to github when done.


deposit => GET: /accounts/:id
withdrawals => PUT: /accounts/:id/withdraw
...Got it!


PUT: /accounts/:id/deposit (+ will be deposit, - will be withdrawals)
